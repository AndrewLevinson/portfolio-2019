# Portfolio Site

> My portolfio redesign for 2019 built with Nuxt.js at andrewlevinson.me that showcases my work in Data Visualization, Product Design, and other misc. projects.

I also used the Storyblok headless CMS for my content and Netlify to deploy.

---

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
